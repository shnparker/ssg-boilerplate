# DO NOT ADD SECRETS TO THIS FILE. This is a good place for defaults.
# If you want to add secrets use `.env.local` instead.
# All env variables that DON'T start with "NEXT_PUBLIC_" MUST be manually exposed by ./next.config.js for the project to work locally
# If you mean to use a variable on the browser, then you should use "NEXT_PUBLIC_", otherwise it will be server only.
